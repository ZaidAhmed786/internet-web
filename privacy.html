<h3>What Personal Information We Collect</h3>

When we use the term "personal information", we are referring to information that identifies, relates to, describes or can be associated with you.

<h3>Information We Obtain from Third Parties</h3>
<p>Finally, we may obtain information about you from third parties, including from vendors and service providers who may collect information on our behalf, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies who support our Site and Services, such as Shopify.</li>
<li>Our payment processors, who collect payment information (e.g., bank account, credit or debit card information, billing address) to process your payment in order to fulfill your orders and provide you with products or services you have requested, in order to perform our contract with you.</li>
<li>When you visit our Site, open or click on emails we send you, or interact with our Services or advertisements, we, or third parties we work with, may automatically collect certain information using online tracking technologies such as pixels, web beacons, software developer kits, third-party libraries, and cookies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any information we obtain from third parties will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Also see the section below,<span>&nbsp;</span><i>Third Party Websites and Links.</i></p>
<h3>How We Use Your Personal Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Providing Products and Services.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>We use your personal information to provide you with the Services in order to perform our contract with you, including to process your payments, fulfill your orders, to send notifications to you related to your account, purchases, returns, exchanges or other transactions, to create, maintain and otherwise manage your account, to arrange for shipping, facilitate any returns and exchanges and other features and functionalities related to your account. We may also enhance your shopping experience by enabling Shopify to match your account with other Shopify services that you may choose to use. In this case, Shopify will process your information as set forth in its Privacy Policy and Consumer Privacy Policy.</li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing and Advertising.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>We may use your personal information for marketing and promotional purposes, such as to send marketing, advertising and promotional communications by email, text message or postal mail, and to show you advertisements for products or services. This may include using your personal information to better tailor the Services and advertising on our Site and other websites.</li>
<li>
<strong>Security and Fraud Prevention.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>We use your personal information to detect, investigate or take action regarding possible fraudulent, illegal or malicious activity. If you choose to use the Services and register an account, you are responsible for keeping your account credentials safe. We highly recommend that you do not share your username, password, or other access details with anyone else. If you believe your account has been compromised, please contact us immediately..</li>
<li>
<strong>Communicating with You and Service Improvement.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>We use your personal information to provide you with customer support and improve our Services. This is in our legitimate interests in order to be responsive to you, to provide effective services to you, and to maintain our business relationship with you</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Like many websites, we use Cookies on our Site. For specific information about the Cookies that we use related to powering our store with Shopify, see<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/cookies" target="_blank">https://www.shopify.com/legal/cookies</a>. We use Cookies to power and improve our Site and our Services (including to remember your actions and preferences), to run analytics and better understand user interaction with the Services (in our legitimate interests to administer, improve and optimize the Services). We may also permit third parties and services providers to use Cookies on our Site to better tailor the services, products and advertising on our Site and other websites.</p>
<p>Most browsers automatically accept Cookies by default, but you can choose to set your browser to remove or reject Cookies through your browser controls. Please keep in mind that removing or blocking Cookies can negatively impact your user experience and may cause some of the Services, including certain features and general functionality, to work incorrectly or no longer be available. Additionally, blocking Cookies may not completely prevent how we share information with third parties such as our advertising partners.</p>
<p>Our website also recognizes the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal, which enables you to opt-out of certain uses or disclosures of your information. If you notify us of your preference through GPC, we will treat such signal as a valid request to opt out of sharing / targeted advertising for the associated browser or device, and, if we are able to associate the device sending the signal to a Shopify account, we will apply the opt out request to the account as well. To learn more about Global Privacy Control, you can visit<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/" target="_blank">https://globalprivacycontrol.org/</a>. Other than the Global Privacy Control, we do not recognize other “Do Not Track” signals that may be sent from your web browser or device.</p>
<h2>How We Disclose Personal Information</h2>
<p>In certain circumstances, we may disclose your personal information to third parties for contract fulfillment purposes, legitimate purposes and other reasons subject to this Privacy Policy. Such circumstances may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>With vendors or other third parties who perform services on our behalf (e.g., IT management, payment processing, data analytics, customer support, cloud storage, fulfillment and shipping).</li>
<li>With business and marketing partners to provide services and advertise to you. Our business and marketing partners will use your information in accordance with their own privacy notices.</li>
<li>When you direct, request us or otherwise consent to our disclosure of certain information to third parties, such as to ship you products or through your use of social media widgets or login integrations, with your consent.</li>
<li>With our affiliates or otherwise within our corporate group, in our legitimate interests to run a successful business.</li>
<li>In connection with a business transaction such as a merger or bankruptcy, to comply with any applicable legal obligations (including to respond to subpoenas, search warrants and similar requests), to enforce any applicable terms of service, and to protect or defend the Services, our rights, and the rights of our users or others.</li>
